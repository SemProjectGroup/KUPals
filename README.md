# KUPals  
A Web-Based Social Platform for Kathmandu University Students

## Project Overview

KUPals is a lightweight, web-based social platform designed specifically for students at Kathmandu University. In a university setting, students often lack a centralized platform for connecting over shared interests and organizing social and academic activities. KUPals bridges that gap by providing:

- Public interest groups (e.g., art, music, hiking, coding clubs)  
- Private groups for focused academic or social discussions  
- Real-time chat and notifications  
- Secure user authentication via Email/Google  
- Responsive UI built with React and Tailwind CSS  
- Scalable backend using Firebase services  

## Features

- **Public Interest Groups**: Discover and join groups based on interests  
- **Private Collaboration Groups**: Create invite-only groups for focused discussions  
- **Real-Time Chat & Notifications**  
- **User Authentication & Profiles**  
- **Privacy & Security** via Firebase Authentication and Firestore Security Rules  
- **Responsive UI** for mobile, tablet, and desktop  
- **Scalable Architecture** with Firebase  
- **Easy Maintenance** with React + Firebase stack
